> This is an _**unofficial**_ tool focused on listing and decryption of secrets 
> with increased performance comparing to native op CLI

## How to use ?

This tool do not replace the official CLI `op` of 1Password. You still need it to perform signin and grab session keys.

So, ensure that you have registered the OP_SESSION_team in your environment.

####Database path

The script will try to search the database at standard path depending on your platform. It it fails or if you want
to use another database, you could set the env variable ONEPASSWORD_LOCAL_DATABASE_PATH with the path 
of the B5.sqlite database you want to use. 

### Get decrypted value
```
op-local get uuid [field] [--use-custom-uuid] [--use-lastpass-uuid]
```

#### TOTP

If you have created a field untitled "One-time password" with a field type "One time password", you can retrieve the
value of the totp by using the special field `totp`. For example: `op-local get uuid totp`.


### List items
```
op-local list [--format='{uuid} {title}'] [--filter=''] [--output-encoding=json]
```

The format string allows you to customize the ouput format of the list items. You can use any field, 
the first match in any section will be used.
 ```
 op-local list --format='{uuid}|{title}|{username}|{password}'
 ```
 
The filter will only return entries whose title contains the filter string. 

By appending, `--output-encoding=json`, you can generate proper JSON encoded lists. For example:
```
op-local list --format='{{"uuid": "{uuid}", "title": "{title}"}},' --output-encoding=json
```

### Is authenticated
```
op-local is-authenticated
```

Check if the 1Password session is opened.

### UUID mapping

uuid in 1Password changes when you move an item from one vault to another. To prevent this issue, a custom uuid
mapping feature has been implemented.

You need to add on each item a field named `UUID`.

Then run `op-local mapping update` to generate the mapping talbe relationship.

You can now get an item using your own `UUID` by appending the `--use-custom-uuid` flag to the `get` command.

`--use-lastpass-uuid` flag does the same thing but with a `LASTPASS_ID` field.

You can display UUID mapping by running `op-local mapping list`.

Since 0.16, and as, UUID v4, Lastpass ID and 1Password UUID are totally different, the search will be performed
over the adequate field regarding which type of uuid is given, without having to use any special flag.

### Multiple accounts

This project support multi-accounts decryption. However, keep in mind that you need:

- to authenticate with the main account of your 1Password desktop client
- to authenticate with the others accounts you want to use

## Known limitations

- Currently, vaults of type E (family shared ?) are not supported. I don't have the need of this kind of vaults currently. Not sure that I will work on this.
- Vaults which are not shared with you are not excluded and will fail the list process. I guess this is an easy fix that will come in a next release.
- Groups permissions are not implemented. Users must be attached to each vaults manually.

## Why this project ?

We use Ansible to manage infrastructures and use a lookup plugin to grab hundred of secrets. 
We used to use LastPass but we decided to move away due to unreliable API calls and unsupported CLI.
First benchmarcks of the native `op` tool, have demonstrated really poor performance around 3 to 4s
to retrieve one secret. As the CLI tool does request to 1Password server to retrieve secrets, performance
is directly impacted by how far your are from their servers.

## Benchmarks

### Get command

#### Official op cli 1m23s

> Performance may depends on how far you are of a 1Password data-center. I live in South of France, nearest is Frankfurt.

## Acknowledgments

This tool couldn't have been possible without the **awesome** work of David Schuetz. (@dschuetz) https://github.com/dschuetz/1password

I would like also to thanks the support team of 1Password and in particular @cohix which helped me a lot to 
understand the remaining internals of 1Password.

Big thanks also to JoÃ«l Franusic and his work on JWK https://github.com/jpf/okta-jwks-to-pem. That helped me to 
drastically improve the performance of the app.

Thanks so much, everyone !
